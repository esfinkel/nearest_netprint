# nearest_netprint
Python-based project.
When run on command line, prints a list of the nearest netprint-enabled printers offered by Cornell.
    -You can specify type of printer with argvs 'color' or 'bw'.
    -If you do not specify, you will receive lists for both.
Requires internet access but no other input.
Note that, as building hours have not yet been inputted, printers suggested to you may be in buildings that are closed.
    -Building hours can typically be manually checked via Google Maps or departmental websites.
    -If anyone knows an API for that, let me know. Or try it yourself.
